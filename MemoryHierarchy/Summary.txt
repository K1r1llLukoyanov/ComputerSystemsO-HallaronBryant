        Summary

    The basic storage technologies are random access memories (RAMs), nonvolatile memories (ROMs), and disks. 
    RAM comes in two basic forms. Static RAM (SRAM) is faster and more expensive and is used for cache memories.
    Dynamic RAM (DRAM) is slower and less expensive and is used for the main memory and graphics frame buffers. 
    ROMs retain their information even if the supply voltage is turned off. They are used to store firmware.
    Rotating disks are mechanical nonvolatile storage devices that hold enormous amounts of data at a low cost per bit,
    but with much longer access times than DRAM. Solid state disks (SSDs) based on nonvolatile flash memory are becoming 
    increasingly attractive alternatives to rotating disks for some applications.

    In general, faster storage technologies are more expensive per bit and have smaller capacities. The price and performance 
    properties of these technologies are changing at dramatically different rates. In particular, DRAM and disk access
    times are much larger than CPU cycle times. Systems bridge these gaps by organizing memory as a hierarchy of storage devices,
    with smaller, faster devices at the top and larger, slower devices at the bottom. Because well-written programs
    have good locality, most data are served from the higher levels, and the effect is a memory system that runs at the rate 
    of the higher levels, but at the cost and capacity of the lower levels.
