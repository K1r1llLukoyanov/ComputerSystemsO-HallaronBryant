Simple computer model:
- CPU - executes instruction.
- Memory system - holds CPU instruction and program data.

In simple model, the memory system is array of bytes, and CPU can access each memory location in a constant amount of time.

In practise, a memory system is a hierarchy of storage devices with different capacities, costs, and access time.
CPU registers hold the most frequently used data.
